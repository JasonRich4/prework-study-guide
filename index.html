        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>An "H 1" header is the top priority followed be H 2,3,4,5, and so on.</li> 
          <li>"p" stands for paragraph, typically used for text.</li> 
          <li>"b" stands for break, giving space between elements on a website.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>In CSS we use class selectors, like ".card" which is used to style topics.</li>
          <li>Padding is commonly confused with margin, but they are not the same.</li>
          <li>Padding is an "interal" in regards to its element, where a margin is "external".</li>
          <li>Increasing the padding makes the element itself larger.</li>
          <li>"*" is known as a "special wild card symbol" which applies to all elements, not a specified style class.</li>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Every command in Git bash begins with "git"</li>
          <li>Using git is so far my favorite part of coding, I enjoy file directory commands/exploration.</li>
          <li>"pwd" stands for "print working directory" effectively telling you where you are within git.</li>
          <li>"ls" lists the current items within the directory you are currently in.</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script, being specific and mindful of the order of code is crucial.</li>
          <li>Calling the function is as equally important as is defining the function.</li>
          <li>The first index (an individual variable) of an array (a group of related data) is always 0.</li>
          <li>Javascript is the most difficult portion of coding so far, but I think I'll come to like it. Or at least appreciate it.</li>
