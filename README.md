## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The motivation behind the Prework study guide was to get a sense of barings of how websites are initially composed and further developed. 
- I had to analyze, comprehend, and execute every layer necessary to run a fully functioning html-based website. Not to imply html was the only language used on the website - I learned and used CSS, JavaScript, Git, and VS (code editing) as well.   
- I designed this website to showcase my understanding of basic coding and web development.
- This has served as a useful, as well as crucial, first stepping stone in my path to becoming a full stack developer.
